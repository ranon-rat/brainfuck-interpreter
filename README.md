# brainfuck-interpreter-made-with-haskell
 a simple haskell interpreter made with love ❤️

 ```
The only commands that you can use when you arent using the repl are:

	help :obviously this is going to show you this
	repl : you can use it for interact with the interpreter
	run   run <program>  : with this you can run the program  
 There is only two commands in the REPL
	:q     		to quit 
	:help  		to list the coomands
	:clear 		clear the screan 
	:reset 		reset the cells and the current cell
  :where-im show you where you are
	:cells
	
 The operators of brainfuck are:

	+ 	to add in the current cell
	- 	to subtract in the current cell
	> 	to move to the next cell
	< 	to move to the previous cell
	. 	to print the current cell
	, 	to print a new line

 The operators for the loop

	[   to open a loop(if the value of the current cell if  is 0 
			it will go to the next cell after "]") 

	] 	this close the loop( if the current value of the cell
		 	when we evaluate this is 0 , the loop ends
		 	and if it doesnt the loop iterate again)
